Many people decide to use things like giving to the poor or helping someone to try to improve the world, but hopefully, after they
read this website they will find out what they can do to change the world from where they are right now. It all starts with humility.</font></p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><font size="+1">If every human became humble, think of how the world would be! Unfortunately, the world is not like that.
It tries any way it can to mess up humans. But if we each, one by one take this lesson into account, the world could change.
<font size="+1">This might not be an overnight process, but it is a continual one. If you look in the urban dictionary you can find the definition of humility as, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=humility">"Remaining teachable, knowing that you do not have all the answers."</a>
Humility is so much more than this. You must not only know that you don't have the answers but also act on that. You must be willing to help your neighbor.
It's not just receiving advice, but also seeing the value of it. That is what humility means.</font></p></font><iframe align="right" width="280" height="210"

<p style="text-indent: 40px"><font size="+1">Pride is one of Humanities worst problems. This website here is to help you get rid of your pride. These following things are going to be painful.
That is the point. They show you that you can't win everything no matter how good you are. Don't try them so much that you rage, but just enough to show you my point.</font></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coolmath-games.com/0-worlds-hardest-game"><font size="+1">This should help teach a thing or two.</font></a><br>
<a href="http://www.gamesgames.com/game//impossible-game-2"><font size="+1">If that earlier one didn't deter you, here is another one!</font></a></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have played these games and personally find them very hard. They are not impossible, but they are very hard. One question I do have to ask is are they harder than being humble? I would be bragging if I say I am a humble person.
I by no means think that I am not in need of this advice. We all need this advice, how much we need it is the question now.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><font size="+1">We also think of humility as a chore. Something we have to do. We don't see all the benefits that humility can provide. It can teach a person how to calm themselves within any storm.
It can help other people through the kindness shown to them. I saw that we should all do what we can to make the world a better place for us and others through humility.</font></p>
